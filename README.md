# 🚀 Employee Management System (EMS)

A **React** project using **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills with authentication, task management, and local storage as the backend.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔑 Authentication**  
  - Separate logins for **Admin** and **Employee**.
  
- **📝 Task Management**  
  - **Admin**: Assign tasks, add details, and track progress.
  - **Employee**: Accept, reject, or mark tasks as "In Progress" or "Completed".

- **⚙️ Local Storage Backend**  
  - Uses browser **local storage** for persistent data management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** - Building the user interface.
- **Vite** - Fast development setup and build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Minimalistic, utility-first styling.
- **JavaScript** - For handling business logic.
- **Local Storage** - For data persistence.

## 📋 Credentials

- **Admin Login**  
  - **Username**: `admin@me.com`  
  - **Password**: `123`
